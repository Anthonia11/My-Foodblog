                        <p>Akara and Pap is Naija's weekend morning meal for most homes because of its light and filling nature. Eating Akara and pap will boost your energy metabolism to get on with your daily activities with ease. Also, it can be eaten for breakfast or dinner or served as a pre-proper meal.

                                <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
                               <li> Grind the four cups of egusi with a dry blender or hand grinding machine and set them aside in a bowl.<br> Add about a cup of water to it and stir to make a very thick paste, as you can see below.</li>
                                <li>Parboil the meat with all the ingredients, it is advisable to parboil meat with some ingredients before adding to the principal food, this improves the taste of the meat.</li>
                                <li>Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of sliced onions.</li>
                                <li>Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, then set aside. Also, remove the center bone from the roasted fishes, wash and set aside too.</li>
                                <li>Set your cooking pot on the fire and add 300ml of palm oil (red oil), allow to heat for a minute but don't allow to bleach. Add the egusi paste and keep stirring for the next eight to ten minutes to form seed-like crumbs. Then transfer the already cooked meat into the pot, stir.</li>
                                <li>Add the washed dry fish, stockfish, ground crayfish, a seasoning cube, ground scotch bonnet pepper, and 2 cups of water. Then cover halfway and allow boiling for the next ten minutes.</li>
                                <li>Stir occasionally to avoid burning. One spoon of ground dawadawa (local ingredients), and a taste for salt and pepper. Add a handful of sliced utazi leaves. Allow to simmer on low heat for 2 minutes, stir, and you just made a delicious pot of egusi soup</li>
                                <li>Eat with your fufu</li>

                        <ul>

                            <li>600g all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>10g fast action yeast</li>
                            <li>150g sugar (use as desired)</li>
                            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
                            <li>550-650g Lukewarm Water</li>
                            <li>1-3tbsp chilli flakes (substitute with cayenne pepper)</li>
                            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
                           <li> In a shallow bowl, add flour and salt together (combine salt with flour first)</li>
                            <li>Add other dry ingredients and combine well</li>
                            <li>Add lukewarm water to the dry mixture in bits to form a batter. </li>
                            <li>You can add 500g at first then check if it needs more water. (the batter should not be runny and it shouldn't be thick as well, find a balance in between the two)</li>
                            <li>Cover the bowl with a cling film or a damp towel and place in a warm place to proof. (Till batter doubles in size usually between an hour or two. You can leave it longer if you want)</li>
                            <li>Once the mixture has risen and doubled in size, you then move on to frying.</li>
                            <li>People always find scooping batter in oil very tricky but I tell you it is very easy. on medium-high heat, add enough oil to a  frying pan and heat till hot. Drop a tiny bit of batter in hot oil to test and if the batter floats to the top of the heat then it is ready to use.</li>
                            <li>simply use a scoop to put the batter into the oil.</li>
                        </ol>
